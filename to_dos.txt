Tasks that I need to get done for the demo: - means finished, + means not finished

Main Priorities:
- Format how the archetypes are listed
- Change Scraper so that it pulls from mtggoldfish.com's main Format pages (TLDR more Archetype data)
- Implement data change function in the Archtype Schema and Scraper
- Clear Unnecessary Styling for right now
+ Finish Formatting of Pages and Make them Responsive
+ Set Up Contact Page, Donation Page, and Link to Github (Twilio, Donation Functionality)
+ Write the About Me Page
+ How to deal with gaps in data, Decks be out of the meta, etc.
+ Sort and Filter Data So what is displayed on the Format Page is the top the 30 archetypes sorted by Meta %

Debugging Priorities:
- Some Archetypes Have the Same Name
- Mono-Green Tron's Data is Messed Up

Going Live:
+ Heroku Setup
+ MongoDB is set up correctly for going Live
